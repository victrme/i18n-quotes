Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak.

Epictetus
First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.

Epictetus
No man is free who is not master of himself.

Epictetus
The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.

Epictetus
Know, first, who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.

Epictetus
Preach not to others what they should eat, but eat as becomes you and be silent.

Epictetus
A ship should not ride on a single anchor, nor life on a single hope.

Epictetus
It is not so much what happens to you as how you think about what happens.

Epictetus
We are not disturbed by what happens to us, but by our thoughts about what happens to us.

Epictetus
Events do not just happen, but arrive by appointment.

Epictetus

Men are not afraid of things, but of how they view them.

Epictetus
It is better to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit, amid abundance.

Epictetus
Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?

Epictetus
No great thing is created suddenly.

Epictetus
When things seem to have reached that stage, merely say “I won’t play any longer”, and take your departure; but if you stay, stop lamenting.

Epictetus
Give me by all means the shorter and nobler life, instead of one that is longer but of less account!

Epictetus
We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.

Epictetus
Nature hath given men one tongue but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak.

Epictetus
Difficulty shows what men are.

Epictetus
Whoever is going to listen to the philosophers needs a considerable practice in listening.

Epictetus
There is but one way to tranquility of mind and happiness, and that is to account no external things thine own, but to commit all to God.

Epictetus
Don't live by your own rules, but in harmony with nature.

Epictetus
First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.

Epictetus
It is more necessary for the soul to be cured than the body; for it is better to die than to live badly.

Epictetus
Is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish? Nothing else.

Epictetus
Imagine for yourself a character, a model personality, whose example you determine to follow, in private as well as in public.

Epictetus
Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinion about the things.

Epictetus
You become what you give your attention to.

Epictetus
Men are disturbed not by the things that happen, but by their opinion of the things that happen.

Epictetus
The essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.

Epictetus
If you want to improve, you must be content to be thought foolish and stupid.

Epictetus
What concerns me is not the way things are, but the way people think things are.

Epictetus
If you seek Truth, you will not seek to gain a victory by every possible means; and when you have found Truth, you need not fear being defeated.

Never say that I have taken it, only that I have given it back.

Epictetus
No man is free until he is a master of himself.

Epictetus
A city is not adorned by external things, but by the virtue of those who dwell in it.

Epictetus
Epictetus being asked how a man should give pain to his enemy answered, By preparing himself to live the best life that he can.

Epictetus
Whoever then would be free, let him wish for nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.

Epictetus
Crows pick out the eyes of the dead, when the dead have no longer need of them; but flatterers mar the soul of the living, and her eyes they blind.

Epictetus
Everyone's life is a warfare, and that long and various.

Epictetus
Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men's desires, but by the removal of desire.

Epictetus
Very little is needed for everything to be upset and ruined, only a slight lapse in reason.

Epictetus
First say to yourself what you would be, and then do what you have to do.

Epictetus
If thy brother wrongs thee, remember not so much his wrong-doing, but more than ever that he is thy brother.

Epictetus
We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.

Epictetus
For it is not death or pain that is to be feared, but the fear of pain or death.

Epictetus
Neither should a ship rely on one small anchor, nor should life rest on a single hope.

Epictetus
Freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired, but by controlling the desire.

Asked how a man should best grieve his enemy, Epictetus replied, "By setting himself to live the noblest life himself."

Epictetus
Who, then, is the invincible human being? One who can be disconcerted by nothing that lies outside the sphere of choice.

Epictetus
Do not try to seem wise to others. If you want to live a wise life, live it on your own terms and in your own eyes.

Epictetus
It is a universal law — have no illusion — that every creature alive is attached to nothing so much as to its own self-interest.

Epictetus
There is no shame in making an honest effort.

Epictetus
The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.

Epictetus
Don't hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace.

Epictetus
Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.

Epictetus
Never say of anything that I've lost it, only that I've given it back.

Epictetus
Death is not dreadful or else it would have appeared dreadful to Socrates.

Epictetus
Reading should serve the goal of attaining peace; if it doesn’t make you peaceful, what good is it?

Epictetus
Fortify yourself with contentment for this is an impregnable fortress.

Epictetus
He who exercises wisdom, exercises the knowledge which is about God.

Epictetus
Circumstances do not rise to meet our expectations. Events happen as they do. People behave as they are. Embrace what you actually get.

Epictetus
There is a time and place for diversion and amusements, but you should never allow them to override your true purposes.

Epictetus
Let your will to avoid have no concern with what is not in man's power; direct it only to things in man's power that are contrary to nature.

Epictetus
Friend, lay hold with a desperate grasp, ere it is too late, on Freedom, on Tranquility, on Greatness of soul!

Epictetus
For what else is tragedy than the portrayal in tragic verse of the sufferings of men who have attached high value to external things?

Man is troubled not by events, but by the meaning he gives to them.

Epictetus
Protect what belongs to you at all costs; don't desire what belongs to another.

Epictetus
In literature, too, it is not great achievement to memorize what you have read while not formulating an opinion of your own.

Epictetus
Adopt new habits yourself: consolidate your principles by putting them into practice.

Epictetus
Tell yourself what you want to be, then act your part accordingly.

Epictetus
Freedom is not archived by satisfying desire, but by eliminating it.

Epictetus
Restrict yourself to choice and refusal; and exercise them carefully, with discipline and detachment.

Epictetus
Circumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.

Epictetus
Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them.

Epictetus
If you have assumed a character beyond your strength, you have both played a poor figure in that, and neglected one that is within your powers.

Epictetus
Who is your master? Whoever has authority over anything that you’re anxious to gain or avoid.

Epictetus
We aren't filled with fear except by things that are bad; and not by them, either, as long as it is in our power to avoid them.

Epictetus
People are ready to acknowledge some of their faults, but will admit to others only with reluctance.

Epictetus

Epictetus
When you find your direction, check to make sure that it is the right one.

Epictetus
Those proficient praise no one, blame no one, and accuse no one. They say nothing concerning their self as being anybody or knowing anything.

Epictetus
Is you naturally entitled, then, to a good father? No, only to a father.

Epictetus
Resistance is vain in any case; it only leads to useless struggle while inviting grief and sorrow.

Epictetus
We should realize that an opinion is not easily formed unless a person says and hears the same things every day and practises them in real life.

Epictetus
The good of man, and likewise his ill, lies in how he exercises his choice, while everything else is nothing to us.

Epictetus
It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning them.

Epictetus
You will never have to experience defeat if you avoid contests whose outcome is outside your control.

Epictetus
You are a little soul carrying around a corpse.

Epictetus

Epictetus

Epictetus
If you wish to be a writer; write!

Epictetus
Understand what words you use first, then use them.

Epictetus

Epictetus
Prefer enduring satisfaction to immediate gratification.

Epictetus
You're not yet Socrates, but you can still live as if you want to be him.

Epictetus
I have learned to see that whatever comes about is nothing to me if it lies beyond the sphere of choice.

Epictetus
In short, we do not abandon any discipline for despair of ever being the best in it.

Epictetus
It is much better to die of hunger unhindered by grief and fear than to live affluently beset with worry, dread, suspicion and unchecked desire.

Epictetus
The husbandman deals with land; physicians and trainers with the body; the wise man with his own Mind.

Epictetus
Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.

Epictetus
Never say of anything that I've lost it, only that Ive given it back.

Epictetus
Tis true I know what evil I shall do but passion overpowers the better council.

Epictetus
First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.

Epictetus
Asked, Who is the rich man? Epictetus replied, "He who is content."

Epictetus
But first consider how much more sparing and patient of hardship the poor are than we.

Epictetus
Always remember what is your own and what is not, and you’ll never be troubled.

Epictetus
Grammar will tell you how to write; but whether to write or not, grammar will not tell.

Epictetus
What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgements about these things.

Epictetus
Only consider at what price you sell your own will: if for no other reason, at least for this, that you sell it not for a small sum.

Epictetus
When something happens, the only thing in your power is your attitude toward it; you can either accept it or resent it.

Epictetus
All philosophy lies in two words, sustain and abstain.

Epictetus
Try to enjoy the great festival of life with other men.

Epictetus
Greatness of reason is measured not by height or length, but by the quality of its judgements.

Epictetus
Seek not for events to happen as you wish but rather wish for events to happen as they do and your life will go smoothly.

Epictetus
You only have to doze a moment, and all is lost. For ruin and salvation both have their source inside you.

Epictetus
Man, the rational animal, can put up with anything except what seems to him irrational; whatever is rational is tolerable.

Epictetus
Taking account of the value of externals, you see, comes at some cost to the value of one's own character.

Epictetus
And where there is ignorance, there is also want of learning and instruction in essentials.

Epictetus
It isn't death, pain, exile or anything else you care to mention that accounts for the way we act, only our opinion about death, pain and the rest.

Epictetus
Freedom, you see, is having events go in accordance with our will, never contrary to it.

Epictetus
Can we avoid people? How is that possible? And if we associate with them, can we change them? Who gives us that power?

Epictetus
Destroy desire completely for the present. For if you desire anything which is not in our power, you must be unfortunate.

Epictetus
If you must be affected by other people's misfortunes, show them pity instead of contempt. Drop this readiness to hate and take offence.

Epictetus
As long as you honour material things, direct your anger at yourself rather than the thief or adulterer.

Epictetus
When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval.

Epictetus
If then you desire aim at such great things remember that you must not attempt to lay hold of them with a small effort.

If you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have both demeaned yourself ill in that and quitted one which you might have supported.

Epictetus
Check your passions that you may not be punished by them.

Epictetus
It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgments about them.

Epictetus
We suffer not from the events in our lives but from our judgement about them.

Epictetus
Faithfulness is the antidote to bitterness and confusion.

Epictetus
From this instant, then, choose to act like the worthy and capable person you are. Follow unwaveringly what reason tells you is the best course.

Epictetus
Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a kind as the author pleases to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, of a long one.

Epictetus
Goodness exists independently of our conception of it. The good is out there and it always has been out there, even before we began to exist.

Epictetus
No man is free unless he is the master of himself.

Epictetus
Be careful to leave your sons well instructed rather than rich, for the hopes of the instructed are better than the wealth of the ignorant.

Epictetus
No person is free who is not master of themselves.

It is our conscience, not our pride, that has put doorkeepers at our doors.

Seneca
The mind is never right but when it is at peace with itself.

Seneca
The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.

Seneca
Sometimes, even to live is an act of courage.

Seneca
There are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.

Seneca
We are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

Seneca
There are more things likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more in our imagination than in reality.

Seneca
One can expect an agreement between philosophers sooner than between clocks.

Seneca
A family formed by crime must be broken by more crime.

Seneca
What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.

Seneca
It is the sign of a weak mind to be unable to bear wealth.

Seneca
He will live ill who does not know how to die well.

Seneca
It should be our care not so much to live a long life as a satisfactory one.

Seneca
There is no great genius without a tincture of madness.

Seneca
No man’s good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt.

Seneca
If you look on wealth as a thing to be valued your imaginary poverty will cause you torment.

Seneca
There is but one chain holding us in fetters, and that is our love of life.

Seneca

Seneca
Possession of a friend should be with the spirit: the spirit's never absent: it sees daily whoever it likes.

Seneca
Believe me if you consult philosophy she will persuade you not to lit so long at your counting desk.

Seneca

Seneca
I am loath to call clemency what was, rather, the exhaustion of cruelty.

Seneca

Seneca
Undisturbed by fears and unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor the gods.

Seneca
Anyone who likes may make things easier for himself by viewing them with equanimity.

Seneca
For Fate/ The willing leads, the unwilling drags along.

Seneca
When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk he said, "Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher."

Seneca

Seneca
I shall never be ashamed to go to a bad author for a good quotation.

Ignorance is no cure for suffering.

Seneca
Fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.

Seneca
The mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply.

Seneca
It is not that we have a short time to live but that we waste a lot of it.

Seneca
Prove - and an easy task it is - that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments...

Seneca
How much better to follow a straight course and attain a goal where the words "pleasant" and "honourable" have the same meaning!

Seneca
What difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it yourself?

Seneca
If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich.

Seneca
The preoccupied become aware of it only when it is over.

Seneca
This evil of taking our cue from others has become so deeply ingrained that even that most basic feeling, grief, degenerates into imitation.

Seneca

Seneca
Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate.

Seneca

Seneca
The fates lead those who will those who won't they drag.

Seneca
While we are postponing, life speeds by.

Seneca
The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.

Seneca
He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.

Seneca
It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more.

Seneca
Nothing happens to the wise man against his expectation.

Seneca
Love sometimes injures. Friendship always benefits.

Seneca
What's the use of overcoming opponent after opponent in the wrestling or boxing rings if you can be overcome by your temper?

Seneca
Who scorns his own life is lord of yours.

Seneca
You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.

Seneca
A good man will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of being busy.

Seneca
Night brings our troubles to the light rather than banishes them.

Seneca
I do not regard a man as poor, if the little which remains is enough for him.

Seneca
Learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.

Seneca
Pleasure, unless it has been kept within bounds, tends to rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.

Seneca
So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil.

Seneca
Everyone hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present.

Seneca
It is wrong not to stretch out your hand to the fallen: that is a common law of the human race.

Seneca
No man has escaped paying the penalty for being born.

Seneca
We live among wicked man through our own wickedness. One thing alone can bring us peace, an agreement to treat one another with kindness.

Seneca
It is only in the ideal or perfect state that the virtues of the good citizen and the good man are identical.

Seneca
Life is long if you know how to use it.

Seneca
Not all men are wounded in the same place; and so you ought to know what part of you is weak, so you can give it the most protection.

Seneca
Peace you can claim for yourself without being disliked by anyone, without any sense of loss, and without any pangs of spirit.

Seneca
When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk he said, 'Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher.

Seneca
If you gain from a crime, you did it.

Seneca
That deed and word should be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same.

Seneca
It takes all of our life to learn how to live, and – something that may surprise you more – it takes just as long to learn how to die.

Seneca
There is an old adage about gladiators, - that they plan their fight in the ring.

Seneca
A great mind becomes a great fortune.

Seneca
No past life has been lived to lend us glory, and that which has existed before us is not ours.

Seneca
We are weak, watery beings standing in the midst of unrealities; therefore let us turn our minds to the things that are everlasting.

Seneca
Truth often harms the one who digs it up.

Seneca
It is the evil mind that gets first hold on all of us.  Learning virtue means unlearning vice.  We.

Seneca
In times of happiness, no point in shaking things up. But in a time of crisis, the safest thing is change.

Seneca

Seneca
If you live according to nature, you will never be poor; if you live according to opinion, you will never be rich.

Seneca
The road is long if one proceeds by way of precepts but short and effectual if by way of personal example.

Seneca
The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.

Seneca
Life’s like a play. It’s not the length but the excellence of the acting that matters.

Seneca
I think the pinnacle of misfortune is to be forced by chance to want things one should loathe.

Seneca
A grey-haired wrinkled man has not necessarily lived long. More accurately, he has existed long.

Seneca
For to be afflicted with endless sorrow at the loss of someone very dear is foolish self-indulgence, and to feel none is inhuman callousness.

Seneca
The best compromise between love and good sense is both to feel longing and to conquer it.

Seneca
Men learn as they teach.

Seneca
All things were ready for us at our birth; it is we that have made everything difficult for ourselves, through our disdain for what is easy.

Seneca
Any man, who does not think that what he has is more than ample, is an unhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.

Seneca
For what can be above the man who is above fortune?

Seneca
It is so, my dear Lucilius; there are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.

Seneca
Only the wise man is content with what is his. All foolishness suffers the burden of dissatisfaction with itself.

Seneca
But every great and overpowering grief must take away the capacity to choose words, since it often stifles the voice itself.

Seneca
No man is so faint-hearted that he would rather hang in suspense for ever than drop once for all.

Seneca
If you wish Pythocles to have pleasure for ever, do not add to his pleasures, but subtract from his desires.

Seneca
If you wish to make Pythocles an old man, filling his life to the full, do not add to his years, but subtract from his desires.

Seneca
Some men have shrunk so far into dark corners that objects in bright daylight seem quite blurred to them.’ A.

Seneca
That which takes effect by chance is not an art.

Seneca
For some persons the remedy should be merely prescribed; in the case of others, it should be forced down their throats.

Seneca
Wealth is the slave of the wise man and master of the fool.

Seneca
Above all, my dear Lucilius, make this your business: learn how to feel joy.

Seneca
What's the good of dragging up sufferings which are over, of being unhappy now just because you were then?

Seneca
Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all.

Seneca
I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what I know, they do not approve, and what they approve, I do not know.

Seneca
And what is more wretched than a man who forgets his benefits and clings to his injuries?

Seneca
When we have done everything within our power, we shall possess a great deal: but we once possessed the world.

Seneca
You can put up with a change of place if only the place is changed.

Seneca
We Stoics are not subjects of a despot: each of us lays claim to his own freedom.

Seneca
When things are at their worst,  there are no tears.

Seneca
Speak ill of yourself when by yourself; then you will become accustomed both to speak and to hear the truth.

Seneca
Besides, he who is feared, fears also; no one has been able to arouse terror and live in peace of mind.

Seneca
Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.

Seneca
If an evil has been pondered beforehand, the blow is gentle when it comes.

Seneca
Life’s finest day for wretched mortals here Is always first to flee.

Seneca
Certain people have good, ordinary blood and others have an animated, lively sort of blood that comes to the face quickly.

Seneca
There is no great genius without tincture of madness.

Seneca
Fire tests gold and adversity tests the brave.

Seneca
Virtue is not vouchsafed to a soul unless that soul has been trained and taught, and by unremitting practice brought to perfection.

Seneca
I shall expose and reopen all the wounds which have already healed.

Seneca
They lose the day in waiting for the night, and the night in fearing the dawn.

Seneca
The day which we fear as our last  is but the birthday of eternity.

Seneca
Can you no longer see a road to freedom? It's right in front of you. You need only turn over your wrists.

Seneca
No one becomes a laughingstock who laughs at himself.

Seneca
There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.

Seneca
A person teaching and a person learning,' he said, 'should have the same end in view: the improvement of the latter.

Seneca
It is a small part of life we really live.’ Indeed, all the rest is not life but merely time.

Seneca
We are all bound by this oath: "To bear the ills of mortal life, and to submit with a good grace to what we cannot avoid."

Seneca
Who can doubt, my dear Lucilius, that life is the gift of the immortal gods, but that living well is the gift of philosophy?

Seneca
The first thing which philosophy undertakes to give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words, sympathy and sociability.

Seneca
Every pleasure is most valued when it is coming to an end.

Seneca
The acquisition of riches has been for many men, not an end, but a change, of troubles.

Seneca
Do you ask what is the foundation of a sound mind? It is, not to find joy in useless things.

Seneca
Reason shows us there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.

Seneca
Time heals what reason cannot.

Seneca
Virtue is according to nature; vice is opposed to it and hostile.

Seneca
We shall consider later whether these evils derive their power from their own strength, or from our own weakness.

Seneca
For if we could be satisfied with anything, we should have been satisfied long ago.

Seneca
The fool's life is empty of gratitude and full of fears; its course lies wholly toward the future.

Seneca
Be aware, then, that every human condition is subject to change, and that whatever mishap can befall any man can also happen to you.

Seneca
In the ashes all men are levelled. We're born unequal, we die equal.

Seneca
A man should therefore grow accustomed to his state and complain about it as little as possible, seizing upon whatever good it may have.

Seneca
No condition is so distressing that a balanced mind cannot find some comfort in it.

Seneca
We do not need many words, but, rather, effective words.

Seneca
Anger will abate and become more controlled when it knows it must come before a judge each day.

Seneca
We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it.

Seneca
There is no favorable wind for the sailor who doesn’t know where to go.

Seneca
Why should I demand of Fortune that she give rather than demand of myself that I should not crave? .

Seneca
Restless people often pretend to be calm.

Seneca
We always feel anger longer than we feel hurt.

Seneca
You have all the fears of mortals and all the desires of immortals.

Seneca
There is only one relief for great sufferings, and that is to endure and surrender to their compulsion.

Seneca
He praised his own achievements, not without cause but without end.

Seneca
Kingdoms which act unjustly never last.

Seneca
Nero: "Am I forbidden to do what all may do?" Seneca: "From high rank high example is expected."

Seneca
Stolid pack-animals are much more fit for carrying loads than thoroughbred horses: who ever subdued their noble speed with a heavy burden?

Seneca
A man who makes a decision without listening to both sides is unjust, even if his ruling is a fair one.

Seneca
For that is the people’s verdict, but wise men on the whole reject the people’s decrees.

Seneca
A hungry people neither listens to reason nor is mollified by fair treatment or swayed by any appeals.

Seneca
Am I not to inquire into the identity of the artist of this universe?

Seneca
When arrogant hands once seize power, the ruler thinks authority resides in stubbornness.

Seneca
Plague on it! what madness this is, to punish one's self because one is unfortunate, and not to lessen, but to increase one's ills!

Seneca
He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.

Seneca
How much happier is the man who owes nothing to anybody except the one he can most easily refuse, himself!

Seneca
Be deaf to those who love you most of all; they pray for bad things with good intentions.

Seneca
Every man, when he first sees light, is commanded to be content with milk and rags. Such is our beginning, and yet kingdoms are all too small for us!

Seneca
The greatest hindrance to living is expectancy, which depends upon the morrow and wastes to-day.

Seneca
The amount of life we truly live is small. For our existence on Earth is not Life, but merely Time.

Seneca
Thus the time we are given is not brief, but we make it so. We do not lack time; on the contrary, there is so much of it that we waste an awful lot.

Seneca
No one can merely go wrong by himself, but he must become both the cause and adviser of another's wrong doing.

Seneca
We are indeed apt to ascribe certain faults to the place or to the time; but those faults will follow us, no matter how we change our place.  You.

Seneca
For men cease to possess all things the moment they desire all things for their own.

Seneca
No man finds it difficult to return to nature, except the man who has deserted nature.  We.

Seneca
All the works of mortal man have been doomed to mortality, and in the midst of things which have been destined to die, we live!

Seneca
The fool, with all his other faults, has this also, he is always getting ready to live.

Seneca
It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and—what will perhaps make you wonder more—it takes the whole of life to learn how to die.

Seneca
Why need we weep over parts of our life? the whole of it calls for tears: new miseries assail us before we have freed ourselves from the old ones.

Seneca
It is while Fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her violence.

Seneca
The problem, Paulinus, is not that we have a short life, but that we waste time.

Seneca
Inwardly, we ought to be different in all respects, but our exterior should conform to society.

Seneca
Life is long and there is enough of it for satisfying personal accomplishments if we use our hours well.

Seneca
For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

Seneca
Det ille veniam facile, cui venia est opus - the one who needs pardon should readily grant it.

Seneca
The liberal arts do not conduct the soul all the way to virtue, but merely set it going in that direction.

Seneca
For how little have we lost, when the two finest things of all will accompany us wherever we go, universal nature and our individual virtue.

Seneca
Then they reflect how pointlessly they acquired things they never would enjoy, and how all their toil has been in vain.

Seneca
Time flies on fickle wings.

Seneca
But learning how to live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die.

Seneca
Often it is better to hide an illness from the patient, because just the mere awareness of a disease can bring about death.

Seneca
There is no need to complain of particular grievances, for life in its entirety is lamentable.

Seneca
Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.

Seneca
There can be no place of exile within the world since nothing within the world is alien to men.

Seneca
The wise man regards the reason for all his actions, but not the results.

Seneca
He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich.

Seneca
We abandon nature and surrender to the mob – who are never good advisers in anything, and in this respect as in all others are most inconsistent.

Seneca
It is not the man who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more.

Seneca
Being without your country is not misery: you have thoroughly taught yourself by your studies to know that to a wise man every place is his country.

Seneca
Do you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety.

Seneca
For it is disheartening to inspire in a man the desire, and to take away from him the hope, of emulation.

Seneca
Count your years, and you will be ashamed to desire and pursue the same things you desired in your boyhood days.

Seneca
No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it.

Seneca
What Chance has made yours is not really yours.

Seneca
Every new beginning comes from other beginning’s end.

Seneca
He who boasts of his descent, praises the deeds of another.

Seneca
To live under constraint is a misfortune, but there is no constraint to live under constraint.

Seneca
A man's peace of mind does not depend upon Fortune; for, even when angry she grants enough for our needs.

Seneca
How can you wonder your travels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with you? You are saddled with the very thing that drove you away.

Seneca
What shall we not go in fear of if we fear that which cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge?

Seneca
If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man.

Seneca
What mental darkness, what ignorance of the truth blinds those who, though afflicted by the fear of poverty, yet take pleasure in imitating it!

Seneca
It takes you more time to solve a problem than to set it.

Seneca
Since the mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply, but rejects everything which is, so to speak, crammed into it.

Seneca
Happy is the man who can make others better, not merely when he is in their company, but even when he is in their thoughts!

Seneca
The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today.

Seneca
Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.

Seneca
We are born under circumstances that would be favourable if we did not abandon them.

Seneca
We cease to be so angry once we cease to be so hopeful.

Seneca
Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness.

Seneca
You can tell the character of every man when you see how he receives praise.”   Difficult.

Seneca
No man is despised by another unless he is first despised by himself.

Seneca
We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it.

Seneca
It was nature’s intention that there should be no need of great equipment for a good life: every individual can make himself happy.

Seneca
Let tears flow of their own accord: their flowing is not inconsistent with inward peace and harmony.

Seneca
Not single is the death which comes; the death Which takes us off is but the last of all.

Seneca
Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.

Seneca
Fortune attacks us as often as we attack Fortune.  It.

Seneca
Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for crisis.

Seneca
No man has been shattered by the blows of Fortune unless he was first deceived by her favours.

Seneca
But the man who is not puffed up in good times does not collapse either when they change.

Seneca
Linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works.

Seneca
In every good person, there lives a god. Which god? We cannot be sure - but it is a god.

Seneca
Long association brings love of evil as well as good.

Seneca
Silently time sneaks up on you, each hour  gone is followed by a worse one.

Seneca
Leisure without books is death, and burial of a man alive.

Seneca
What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily?

Seneca
The young character, which cannot hold fast to righteousness, must be rescued from the mob.

Seneca
Harmony makes small things grow; lack of harmony makes great things decay.

Seneca
Men love their country, not because it is great, but because it is their own.

Seneca
The shortest route to wealth is the contempt of wealth.

Seneca
It is not because things are difficult, that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that Things are difficult.

Seneca
Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom yourself can improve. Men learn while they teach.

Seneca
Disasters, therefore, and losses, and wrongs, have only the same power over virtue that a cloud has over the sun.

Seneca
Longing for the future and weariness of the present.

Seneca
It's easier to get philosophers to agree than clocks.

Seneca
Those who choose to have no real purpose in life are ever rootless and dissatisfied, tossed by their aimlessness into ever-changing situations.

Seneca
Who as though inspired with divine utterance sings salutary verses: Life.

Seneca
No one willingly reverts to the past unless all his actions have passed his own censorship, which is never deceived.

Seneca
Conversation has a kind of charm about it, an insuating and insidious something that elicits secrets from us just like love or liquor.

Seneca
You live as if you will live forever, no care for your mortality ever enters your head, you pay no mind to how much time has already gone by.

Seneca
Hence the dictum of the greatest of doctors:† ‘Life is short, art is long.

Seneca
No man, if he be ungrateful, will be unhappy in the future. I allow him no day of grace; he is unhappy forthwith.

Seneca
The present alone can make no man wretched.

Seneca
There is no easy way from the earth to the stars.

Seneca
If you would escape your troubles, you need not another place but another personality.

Seneca
The busy man is busy with everything except living; there is nothing that is more difficult to learn how to do right.

Seneca
Every pleasure is most valued when it is coming to an end?

Seneca
Shall I tell you what philosophy holds out to humanity? Counsel.

Seneca
While we are postponing, life speeds by.

Seneca
Lay hold of today's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's.

Seneca
Leisure without study is death; it is a tomb for the living man.

Seneca
That which Fortune has not given, she cannot take away.

Seneca
Fortune recently took away her mother, but your love will mean that she will only grieve over her mother’s loss but not suffer for it.

Seneca
For only philosophy or honourable occupation can divert from its anguish a heart whose grief springs from love.

Seneca
Those who lack self-control lead disturbed and tumultuous lives; their crimes are balanced by their fears, and they are never at ease.

Seneca
If you want to keep a secret, never share it.

Seneca
To be everywhere, is to be no where at all.

Seneca
Therefore whenever his last day comes, the wise man will not hesitate to meet death with a firm step.

Seneca
For the wise man regards wealth as a slave, the fool as a master.

Seneca
For that love is greater which wins less through equal danger.

Seneca
To be everywhere; is to be nowhere.

Seneca
Lay hold of today's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by.

Seneca
If you wish to fear nothing, consider that all things are to be feared.

Seneca
To be everywhere; is to nowhere.

Seneca
No one is the object of another man's contempt, unless he is first the object of his own.

Seneca
Greed is satisfied by nothing, but nature finds satisfaction even in scant measure.

Seneca
It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.

Seneca
Is natural to touch more often the part that hurts.

Seneca
We are not given a short life but we make it short... Life is long if you know how to use it.

Seneca
Nothing satisfies greed, but even a little satisfies nature.

Seneca
Those who forget the past, ignore the present, and fear for the future have a life that is very brief and filled with anxiety.

Seneca
Those who are busy with other things do not notice it until the end comes.

Seneca
Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.

Seneca
How late it is to begin living only when one must stop!

Seneca
You fear everything as mortals but desire to have everything as gods.

Seneca
They are like prowling enemies who pounce on you when occasion offers, and allow you neither to be at the ready as in war nor at ease as in peace.

Seneca
That day, which you fear as being the end of all things, is the birthday of your eternity.

Seneca
All that remains of our existence is not actually life but merely time.

Seneca

If you wish to be loved, love.

Seneca

Marcus Aurelius
Manage all your actions, words, and thoughts accordingly, since you may at any moment quit life.

Marcus Aurelius
Live as though today is your last day.

Marcus Aurelius
If you are distressed about anything, the pain is not one to the thing but to your own estimate to it.

Marcus Aurelius
He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury.

Marcus Aurelius
The freedom to do only what God wants, and accept whatever God sends us.

Marcus Aurelius
When you are offended at any man’s fault, immediately turn to yourself and reflect in what manner you yourself have erred.

Marcus Aurelius
If you are distressed about anything, the pain is not due to the thing but to your own estimate of it.

Marcus Aurelius
Tranquillity is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.

Marcus Aurelius
A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse.”—Epictetus.

Marcus Aurelius
Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.

Marcus Aurelius
Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.

Marcus Aurelius
You are a spirit, bearing the weight of a dead body, as Epictetus used to say.

Marcus Aurelius
III. Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and died.

Marcus Aurelius
But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not die murmuring, but cheerfully, truly, and from thy heart thankful to the gods.

Marcus Aurelius
A man cannot lose a thing if he has it not.

Marcus Aurelius
The mind is that which is roused and directed by itself. It makes of itself what it chooses. It makes what it chooses of its own experience.

Marcus Aurelius
Does a man offend your pride? Remember he will be dead soon, as will you.

Marcus Aurelius
Death. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.

Marcus Aurelius
Fire feeds on obstacles.

Marcus Aurelius
Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy.

Marcus Aurelius
As for thy thirst after books, away with it with all speed.

Marcus Aurelius
And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things—they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well.

Marcus Aurelius
To love only what happens, what was destined. No greater harmony.

Marcus Aurelius
It stares you in the face. No role is so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.

Marcus Aurelius
Remember: philosophy requires only what your nature already demands.

Marcus Aurelius
Keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to care for all human beings is part of being human.

Marcus Aurelius
If they’ve made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can’t do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one.

Marcus Aurelius
The ruler must be a philosopher as well as a king; and he must govern unwillingly, because he loves philosophy better than dominion.

Marcus Aurelius
I have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured anyone else if I could avoid it?

Marcus Aurelius
If it doesn't harm your character, how can it harm your life?

Marcus Aurelius
Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy.

Marcus Aurelius
Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.

Marcus Aurelius
I am happy, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.

Marcus Aurelius
Soon, you will have forgotten everything.  Soon, everybody will have forgotten you.

Marcus Aurelius
Nothing happens to any man that he is not formed by nature to bear.

Marcus Aurelius
With how little he was satisfied, such as lodging, bed, dress, food, servants.

Marcus Aurelius
To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken of: whom.

Marcus Aurelius
You should always look on human life as short and cheap. Yesterday sperm: tomorrow a mummy or ashes.

Marcus Aurelius
For the sole thing of which any man can be deprived is the present; since this is all he owns, and nobody can lose what is not his.

Marcus Aurelius
Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage.

Marcus Aurelius
Your mind will take on the character of your most frequent thoughts: souls are dyed by thoughts.

Marcus Aurelius
Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.

Marcus Aurelius
Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.

Marcus Aurelius
Our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.

Marcus Aurelius
A poor soul burdened with a corpse,' Epictetus calls you.

Marcus Aurelius
For all things fade and turn to fable, and quickly too, utter oblivion covers them like sand.

Marcus Aurelius
Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them then or bear with them.

Marcus Aurelius
No difference between here and there: the city that you live in is the world.

Marcus Aurelius
To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus tomorrow will be a mummy or ashes.

Marcus Aurelius
Does the emerald lose its beauty for lack of admiration? Does gold, or ivory, or purple? A lyre or a dagger, a rosebud or a sapling?

Marcus Aurelius
They despise one another, yet they flatter one another;they sant to get above another and get they bow down to one another.

Marcus Aurelius
Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.

Marcus Aurelius
He who has seen the present has seen everything, that which happened in the most distant past and that which will happen in the future.

Marcus Aurelius
It was my tutor who dissuaded me from patronizing Green or Blue at the races, or Light or Heavy in the ring.

Marcus Aurelius
You can live here as you expect to live there.

Marcus Aurelius
Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight.

Marcus Aurelius
Don't live as though you were going to live a myriad years. Fate is hanging over your head; while you have life, while you may, become good.

Marcus Aurelius
Waste no more time arguing that a good man should be. Be one.

Marcus Aurelius
The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion.

Marcus Aurelius
Objective judgment … Unselfish action … Willing acceptance … of all external events.

Marcus Aurelius
Nothing happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to bear.

Marcus Aurelius
To the world: Your harmony is mine. Whatever time you choose is the right time. Not late, not early.

Marcus Aurelius
The whole Universe is change, and life itself is but what you deem it.

Marcus Aurelius
What is not good for the hive is no good for the bee.

Marcus Aurelius
It is ridiculous not to escape from one’s own vices, which is possible, while trying to escape the vices of others, which is impossible.

Marcus Aurelius
And to behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want to make up.

Marcus Aurelius
The universe is flux, life is opinion.

Marcus Aurelius
To undertake nothing: i. at random or without a purpose; ii. for any reason but the common good.

Marcus Aurelius
At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suffer joyously.

Marcus Aurelius
Work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such anxiety, in the calm of self surrender.

Marcus Aurelius
Today I have got out of all trouble, or rather I have cast out all trouble, for it was not outside, but within and in my opinions.

Marcus Aurelius
Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.

Marcus Aurelius
The thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

Marcus Aurelius
Pride is a master of deception: when you think you’re occupied in the weightiest business, that’s when he has you in his spell.

Marcus Aurelius
Is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?

Marcus Aurelius
Be content to seem what you really are.

Marcus Aurelius
Do not suppose you are hurt, and your complaint ceases; cease your complaint, and you are not hurt.

Marcus Aurelius
And he cares nothing for their praise—men who can’t even meet their own standards.

Marcus Aurelius
And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys.

Marcus Aurelius
BEGIN the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.

Marcus Aurelius
And not to think of philosophy as your instructor, but as the sponge and egg white that relieve ophthalmia—as a soothing ointment, a warm lotion.

Marcus Aurelius
If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you.

Marcus Aurelius
Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech.

Marcus Aurelius
How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything which happens in life.

Marcus Aurelius
Death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back.

Marcus Aurelius
To grumble at anything that happens is a rebellion against Nature, in some part of which are bound up the natures of all other things.

Marcus Aurelius
Where a man can live, there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace;- well then, he can also live well in a palace.

Marcus Aurelius
Sexual ecstasy is like death. It is one of the secrets of nature’s wisdom.

Marcus Aurelius
The best kind of revenge is not to become like them.

Marcus Aurelius
Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we’re practically showered with them.

Marcus Aurelius
He may not be profound, he is always sincere.

Marcus Aurelius
Practice even what seems impossible.

Marcus Aurelius
It should be a man's task, says the Imitation, 'to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.

Marcus Aurelius
Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.

Marcus Aurelius
Vex not thy spirit at the course of things,they not heed thy vexations.

Marcus Aurelius
Let the god that is within you be the champion of the being you are.

Marcus Aurelius
Do you have reason? I have. Why then do you not use it? For if reason does its own work, what else could you wish for?

Marcus Aurelius
All things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. And I say this of those who have shone in a wondrous way.

Marcus Aurelius
Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it?

Marcus Aurelius
Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it, in passing from one social act to another social act, thinking of God.

Marcus Aurelius
Whatever happens to every man, this is for the interest of the universal.

Marcus Aurelius
Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.

Marcus Aurelius
Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.

Marcus Aurelius
We shrink from change; yet is there anything that can come into being without it?

Marcus Aurelius
Your character is simply the sum of your thoughts over time.

Marcus Aurelius
Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of anything pass thee, before thou hast fully it.

Marcus Aurelius
Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion.

Marcus Aurelius
And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety.

Marcus Aurelius
How rotten and spurious is the man who says: “I have decided to be straightforward with you.”

Marcus Aurelius
From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.

Marcus Aurelius
Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you can see the road, follow it.

Marcus Aurelius
The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.

Marcus Aurelius
Wait for it patiently—annihilation or metamorphosis.

Marcus Aurelius
The soul becomes dyed with the colours of its thoughts.

Marcus Aurelius
Love that only which happens to thee and is spun with the thread of thy destiny. For what is more suitable? In.

Marcus Aurelius
He who follows reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the same time, and also cheerful and collected.

Marcus Aurelius
Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy.

Marcus Aurelius
Wherever you go, there you are—the same person, with the same patterns of thought.

Marcus Aurelius
Every portion of me will be reassigned as another portion of the world, and that in turn transformed into another. Ad infinitum.

Marcus Aurelius
Still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses.

Marcus Aurelius
Enter their minds, and you'll find the judges you're so afraid of—and how judiciously they judge themselves.

Marcus Aurelius
You are but an impression, and not at all what you seem to be.

Marcus Aurelius
Of all existing things some are in our power, and others are not in our power.

Marcus Aurelius
This that I am, whatever it be, is mere flesh and a little breath and the ruling Reason.

Marcus Aurelius
Some things are hurrying into existence, and others are hurrying out of it.

Marcus Aurelius
Continually, and, if possible, in the case of every mental image, consider its nature, realize its emotional content, and judge it rationally.

Marcus Aurelius
Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end.

Marcus Aurelius
For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him?

Marcus Aurelius
Soon you'll be ashes or bones. A mere name at most - and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, trivial.

Marcus Aurelius
How unsound and insincere is he who says, I have determined to deal with thee in a fair way.—What art thou doing, man?

Marcus Aurelius
Finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded.

Marcus Aurelius
To grieve or be angry about or fear what happens to you is to be a fugitive from the law of nature.

Marcus Aurelius
How plain does it appear that there is not another condition of life so well suited for philosophising as this in which thou now happenest to be.

Marcus Aurelius
We are all mere nuggets of incense on the one altar. Some burn down now, some later - there is no difference.

Marcus Aurelius
Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not follow after.

Marcus Aurelius
As they that long after figs in winter when they cannot be had; so are they that long after children, before they be granted them.

Marcus Aurelius
A ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to be flattered; able to govern both himself and others.

Marcus Aurelius
Studying philosophy instills modesty and straightforwardness in your character.

Marcus Aurelius
Time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.

Marcus Aurelius
But by all means bear this in mind, that within a very short time both thou and he will be dead; and soon not even your names will be left behind.

Marcus Aurelius
He blind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding.

Marcus Aurelius
How many of them who came into the world at the same time when I did, are already gone out of it? LII.

Marcus Aurelius
It is only this present, a moment of time, that a man lives: all the rest either has been lived or may never.

Marcus Aurelius
It is only this present, a moment of time, that a man lives: all the rest either has been lived or may never be.

Marcus Aurelius
To recover your life is within your power; simply view things again as once you viewed them, for your revival rests in that.

Marcus Aurelius
Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst be tranquil.

Marcus Aurelius
What is this, fundamentally? What is its nature and substance, its reason for being? What is it doing in the world? How long is it here for?

Marcus Aurelius
Obsequious courting of the mob.

Marcus Aurelius
Put from you the belief that I have been wronged and with it will go the feeling. Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.

Marcus Aurelius
Every man is worth just so much as the things are worth about which he busies himself.

Marcus Aurelius
The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer’s is part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.

Marcus Aurelius
Whatever happens at all happens as it should; you will find this true, if you watch narrowly.

Marcus Aurelius
And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.

Marcus Aurelius
Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you.

Marcus Aurelius
The universe is transformation; life is opinion.

Marcus Aurelius
There is nothing more shameful than perfidious friendship.

Marcus Aurelius
Our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.

Marcus Aurelius
Never wilt your soul, never be just good, simple or unpolished. Manifest more then the body that surrounds yourself.

Marcus Aurelius
It is crazy to want what is impossible. And impossible for the wicked not to do so.

Marcus Aurelius
Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse.

Marcus Aurelius
For a man to be proud and high conceited, that he is not proud and high conceited, is of all kind of pride and presumption, the most intolerable.

Marcus Aurelius
Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood—and nothing else is under your control.

Marcus Aurelius
The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.

Marcus Aurelius
Accept the things to which life binds you, and love the people with whom life brings you together, but do so with all your heart.

Marcus Aurelius
It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinions than our own.

Marcus Aurelius
Think of the countless changes in which you yourself have bad a part. The whole universe is change, and life is but what you deem it.

Marcus Aurelius
A society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else.

Marcus Aurelius
Death is such as generation is, a mystery of nature; a composition out of the same elements, and a decomposition into the same.

Marcus Aurelius
Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions.

Marcus Aurelius
In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations? Always.

Marcus Aurelius
Such as you are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for your soul is dyed through the thoughts.

Marcus Aurelius
Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to live ... while you have life in you, while you still can, make yourself good.

Marcus Aurelius
How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything that happens in life.

Marcus Aurelius
Self reliance, always. And cheerfulness.

Marcus Aurelius
If within the power of another, whom do you blame - atoms or gods? To do either is folly.

Marcus Aurelius
Never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.

Marcus Aurelius
My city and my country, as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as I am a man, it is the world.

Marcus Aurelius
For in those things that properly belong unto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man.

Marcus Aurelius
Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good one.

Marcus Aurelius
The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.

Marcus Aurelius
And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last.

Marcus Aurelius
All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it.

Marcus Aurelius
It is royal to do good and to be abused.

Marcus Aurelius
Even chance is not divorced from nature, from the inweaving and and enfolding of things governed by Providence.

Marcus Aurelius
Be not either a man of many words, or busy about too many things.
